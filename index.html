						<h2>More About Me</h2>
						<article>
							<h3>Instruction</h3>
							<p>During the Classical studies I learned how to appreciate ancient history, literature and mythology. I strongly believe that the study of the past is essential to understand the present and somehow the future.
							In this time I have been elected President of the students for three consecutive years, giving a lot for my school and my mates with a lot of cultural and recreational activities.
							<br>
							After the High School my studies continued in the computers world: this passion was born for the curiosity's sake because I have always wanted to understand how computers work in all their aspectes. That's why I have choosen Engineering in Computer Science, both for my Bachelor's and Master's Degree.
							<br>
							I've always been attracted from projecting and programming, and my academic path is driving me into the best way.
							</p>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h3>Science and Technology</h3>
							<p> Other than my studies, I am passionate about science and technology: I love to stay tuned in new technologies, solutions and ideas that could make this world better.
							<br>
							From technology to astronomy, passing by biology I like to read more and more to have a nice idea on how the world works.
							<br>
							I also like to read about cyber security and to teach people around me about the risks and possibilities of the internet: I strongly believe that education is essential for living well in a fully connected world.
							</p>

							<h3>Sky and Space</h3>
							<p> Since I was i child the sky has always been part of my life: I've grown up always looking up, having fun by learning new stuffs about jet airplanes and dreaming under the stars.
							<br>
							This close bond with the sky has been my fuel to pursue the dream of flying, that's why I learned to fly as an amateur pilot. 
							<br>
							This quote from Leonardo Da Vinci well describes the realization of my dream:
							<br>
							<i> “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.” </i>
							<br>
							My strong passion for what is above us moves my desire on orienting my studies in order to give my contributions as a Computer Engineer in the aerospace sector: the future is now, and I really want to be part of it.
							</p>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h3> Personal goals </h3>
							<p> As I have said before, I am proud of myself for making my dream to fly true. To look at the world from above is a very intensive and life-changing experience.
							<br>
							Other than that, I have the passion of gardening and growing hot peppers: I think that life is like true magic, and plants have taught me that patience and hard work always pay.
							<br>
							One more thing I like to do in my free time is practicing Kick Boxing: I am now a brown belt in this combact sport and I am studying for the black belt with instructor grades.

							The advent of interplanetary colonization has become. Living on our  satellite will be characterized by a massive presence of technology,  from which lives will rely, as well as a huge amount of research tools,  all of them coordinated in groups in several districts of the Moon. The  need to make all these facilities to communicate with each other arises,  together with the need to talk with Home and, last but not least,  accessing the Internet from the Moon.

							<h3>Talking Chalks</h3>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/PanK0/TalkingChalks" target="_blank"> GitHub Link </a> <br>
							<a href="https://www.hackster.io/348161/talking-chalks-d497bc" target="_blank"> Hackster Blog </a>
							<br>
							TalkingChalks is an IoT system that can be used in a museum. It can help visitors during the tour providing information about the museum, the statues and the story behind them. A smartband with the most suitable profile will be provided to each visitor, so that can everyone can have a customized experience.
							<br>
							<b> Why TalkingChalks?</b> TalkingChalks was born for the course of IoT @ Sapienza University of Rome. <br>
							During a conference with the curators of the Sapienza Museum of Classical Art we found out that they needed some systems to give some freshness to the Museum. Among the requestes and the ideas it came out that they do not have audio guides, and so we invented TalkingChalks to help the Museum giving some attractiveness for users by letting the statues - literally - talk. <br>
							TalkingChalks is the effective rensponse to what they need, and we made it real by investigating among the users on what would be the best way to make TalkingChalks real: we made surveys, tests, we added personalized profiles and appreciation recognition. Then we merged our knowledge to develop a simple and solid system to give statues a voice.
							Here is TalkingChalks.

							<h3>Environmental Stations</h3>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/PanK0/iot-project" target="_blank"> GitHub Link </a> <br>
							 In this project I have experimented new technologies from the IOT world, such as MQTT Protocol, RIOT Operating System, Cloud facilities like ThingsBoard, simulated environments from IOt-lab, LoRa Technology, TheThingsNetwork, Generic Sensors API and much more. 
							 <br>
							 Everything has been done and evaluated during the IoT Course @ Sapienza University of Rome.

							<h3> Development of a File System Based on iNodes</h3>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/PanK0/iNode_FS" target="_blank"> GitHub Link </a> <br>
							 This project is part of my Bachelor's Degree Thesis and it is about the development of a simple File System based on iNodes.
							 <br>
							 The project comes from an evolution of a previous project from the Operating System course, the development of a File System based on Linked Lists: by developing two simple File Systems I have tried by my hands what a File System is and how to implement it in the best way, facing all the problems and needings of this important part of an Operating System.

							<h3>Linked Lists Based File System </h3>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/PanK0/SO_FS" target="_blank"> GitHub Link </a> 
							<br>
							The project Simple File System (SimpleFS) is a didactic project that focuses on the development of a basic File System. It's composed by three levels - Bitmap, DiskDriver, SimpleFS - done to work together in a vertical layout to create and manage files and folders.
							<br>
							This work has been done and evaluated during the course of Operating Systems in my Bachelor's Degree and its evolution became my final Thesis.

							<br>
							OpenChallenge is a new app that allows you to challenge your friends in anything that comes to your mind.
							<br>
							The focus is on people meeting in a place to take part in challenges: here people are not passive and can put themselves to the test or just have fun with close friends.
							<br>
							Pubs are an important part of the atmosphere and are especially encouraged to organize challenges in order to increase the number of clients of their activities!
							<br>
							This project has been developed during the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/google-technologies-for-cloud-and-web-development/" target="_blank">Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development </a> Workshop.
